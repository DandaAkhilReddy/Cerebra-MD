## API Key Considerations

### Single Key Benefits
- Lower total cost
- Simpler configuration
- Adequate for most use cases
- Easier to manage and monitor

### When to Consider Two Keys
- High-volume concurrent API calls (>50 simultaneous)
- Need for failover/redundancy
- Separation of read vs write operations
- Multiple environments (staging/production)

### Rate Limits (Per Key)
- **Requests per second**: 10
- **Concurrent connections**: 25
- **Daily request limit**: 100,000
- **Batch size limit**: 1,000 records

---

## Cost Optimization Tips

1. **Start with one key** and monitor usage
2. **Batch API calls** to reduce request count
3. **Implement caching** for frequently accessed data
4. **Use webhooks** instead of polling where available
5. **Schedule heavy operations** during off-peak hours

---

## Payment Terms

- **Setup Fee**: Due upon contract signing
- **Monthly Fees**: Billed monthly in advance
- **Payment Methods**: ACH, Wire, Credit Card
- **Contract Length**: Annual (month-to-month after first year)
