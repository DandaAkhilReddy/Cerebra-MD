| **Azure Container Apps (Backend API)** | 1 container, 1 vCPU/2GB RAM, ~60% utilization | $120 |
| **Azure App Service (Frontend)** | Linux B2 tier (2 vCPU/3.5GB) or Windows B1 | $60 |
| **Azure Databricks (ETL)** | Jobs compute only, 2-4 hours nightly, spot instances | $450 |
| **Databricks SQL Warehouse** | Serverless, auto-pause after 10 min | $200 |

**Subtotal: $830**

### 2. Storage & Data

| Service | Configuration | Monthly Cost |
|---------|--------------|-------------|
| **Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2** | 1TB hot storage + 1TB cool archive | $80 |
| **Transaction costs** | ~5M transactions/month | $40 |
| **Backup Storage** | GRS backups, 500GB | $25 |

**Subtotal: $145**

### 3. Networking & Security

| Service | Configuration | Monthly Cost |
|---------|--------------|-------------|
| **API Management** | Consumption tier, ~2M calls/month | $120 |
| **Private Endpoints** | 3 endpoints (Storage, KeyVault, SQL) | $75 |
| **Azure Key Vault** | Standard tier, ~1000 operations/day | $20 |
| **Application Gateway/WAF** | Basic tier for frontend | $80 |

**Subtotal: $295**

### 4. Monitoring & Management

| Service | Configuration | Monthly Cost |
|---------|--------------|-------------|

| **Log Analytics Workspace** | 5GB logs, 30-day retention | $40 |
| **Azure Monitor Alerts** | 10 alert rules | $10 |

**Subtotal: $130**

### 5. Additional Services

| Service | Configuration | Monthly Cost |
|---------|--------------|-------------|
| **Bandwidth (Egress)** | ~50GB/month to internet | $45 |
| **Azure AD B2C** | First 50K MAU free | $0 |
| **Backup Service** | Azure Backup for configs | $20 |
| **Contingency** | 5% buffer for overages | $70 |

**Subtotal: $135**

## Cost Optimization Strategies

### Immediate Optimizations (Can implement now)
1. **Databricks**: Use spot instances for batch jobs (saves ~30%)
2. **Storage**: Implement lifecycle policies to move old data to cool/archive tiers
3. **Compute**: Use B-series burstable VMs for variable workloads
4. **SQL Warehouse**: Configure aggressive auto-pause (10 minutes)

### Future Optimizations (As you scale)
1. **Reserved Instances**: 1-year commitments save ~30-40% on compute
2. **Azure Hybrid Benefit**: If you have Windows Server licenses
3. **Consumption Plans**: Move more services to serverless/consumption models
4. **Data Optimization**: Compress data, use Delta Lake optimization

## Scaling Considerations

### If traffic increases 10x:
- Container Apps: Auto-scales, add ~$200-300/month
- API Management: Scales automatically, add ~$100/month
- Databricks: Same nightly window, minimal increase

### If data volume increases 10x:
- Storage: Add ~$200/month for 10TB
- Databricks: Longer processing, add ~$300/month
- Transaction costs: Add ~$100/month

## Comparison to Original Estimate

| Category | Original Estimate | Optimized Estimate | Savings |
|----------|------------------|-------------------|---------|
| Compute | $1,200 | $830 | $370 |
| Storage | $200 | $145 | $55 |
| Networking | $400 | $295 | $105 |
| Monitoring | $200 | $130 | $70 |
| Other | $500 | $135 | $365 |
| **Total** | **$2,500** | **$1,520** | **$980** |

**Key Changes:**
- Switched to consumption/serverless tiers where possible
- Right-sized compute resources for MVP load
- Optimized Databricks usage (jobs-only, spot instances)
- Reduced monitoring data retention
- Eliminated non-essential services for MVP
