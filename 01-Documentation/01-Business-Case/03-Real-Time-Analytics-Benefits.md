### The Analytics Revolution You'll Experience

```
Traditional Monthly Reports    →    Real-Time Intelligence
         (3-4 weeks delay)              (updated every 15 minutes)
              ↓                                    ↓
    "What happened last month?"        "What's happening right now?"
    "Why did we lose money?"          "How can we prevent loss today?"
    "Which doctor performed poorly?"   "Which doctor needs help this hour?"
```
