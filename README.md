### 3. **Overall AR (Accounts Receivable) Management**
- **Aging Analysis**: Real-time AR aging buckets (0-30, 31-60, 61-90, 90+ days)
- **Collection Performance**: Track collection rates, write-offs, and recovery efficiency
- **Payer Performance**: Monitor payment speed and patterns by insurance provider
- **Cash Flow Forecasting**: Predict incoming payments based on historical collection patterns
- **Bad Debt Analytics**: Identify accounts at risk and optimize collection strategies

### 4. **Revenue Cycle Optimization**
- **Predicted Revenue Based on Census**: Forecast monthly/quarterly revenue using patient census data
- **Delayed Bills Analysis**: Track billing delays, root causes, and financial impact
- **Encounter Processing**: Monitor encounter-to-bill conversion rates and timeline
- **Charge Capture Efficiency**: Identify missed charges and revenue leakage
- **Submission Timeline Analytics**: Track claim submission speed and first-pass success rates

### 5. **Operational Intelligence**
- **Census-Based Predictions**: ML models predicting revenue based on patient volume and case mix
- **Workflow Bottlenecks**: Identify delays in billing processes from encounter to collection
- **Resource Allocation**: Optimize staff allocation based on workload and performance metrics
- **Compliance Monitoring**: Track regulatory compliance and audit readiness
- **Financial KPI Dashboard**: Real-time monitoring of key financial performance indicators

## 📊 Advanced Analytics Features

### Predictive Models
- **Revenue Forecasting**: 3, 6, and 12-month revenue predictions based on census trends
- **Denial Risk Scoring**: Pre-submission claim risk assessment
- **Collection Probability**: Likelihood of payment recovery for aged accounts
- **Physician Productivity Forecasting**: Predict future performance trends

### Interactive Dashboards
- **Executive Summary**: High-level KPIs for C-suite leadership
- **Departmental Views**: Specialized dashboards for billing, clinical, and finance teams
- **Drill-down Capabilities**: Click-through analysis from summary to detail level
