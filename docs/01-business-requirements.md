## Why Cerebra-MD Exists

---

## The Problem

Healthcare organizations lose **15-30% of potential revenue** due to:

### 1. Claim Denials (costs $8.6B annually)
- Average denial rate: 10-15%
- Only 65% of denials are appealed
- 45% of appeals are successful
- Each denial costs $25-118 to rework

### 2. Inefficient Revenue Cycle
- 40+ days average in accounts receivable
- Manual processes prone to errors
- Lack of real-time visibility
- Reactive vs proactive management

### 3. Data Silos
- EMR data disconnected from billing
- No unified view of revenue performance
- Reports take days/weeks to generate
- Insights arrive too late to act
