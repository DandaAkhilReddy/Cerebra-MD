   - Performance monitoring

## Technical Implementation

### Data Extraction Methods

#### 1. API-Based Extraction
```python
# AdvancedMD API integration
class AdvancedMDExtractor:
    def extract_encounters(self, start_date, end_date):
        # API calls with pagination
        # Error handling and retry logic
        # Data validation
        pass
```

#### 2. Database Direct Access (if available)
```sql
-- SQL Server/Oracle queries for bulk extraction
SELECT * FROM encounters 
WHERE modified_date >= @last_run_date
```

### Data Transformation Logic

#### Bronze to Silver Transformation
```python
# Data cleansing and standardization
def cleanse_patient_data(df):
    # Remove duplicates
    # Standardize formats
    # Validate data quality
    # Apply business rules
    return cleaned_df
```

#### Silver to Gold Transformation
```python
# Business logic and aggregations
def calculate_kpis(df):
    # Revenue calculations
    # Denial rate calculations
    # AR aging buckets
    # Physician performance metrics
    return kpi_df
```

### Data Quality Framework

#### Validation Rules
1. **Completeness**: Required fields validation
2. **Accuracy**: Business rule validation
3. **Consistency**: Cross-table validation
4. **Timeliness**: Data freshness checks

#### Quality Monitoring
```python
# Great Expectations data quality suite
expectation_suite = {
    "encounter_completeness": "expect_column_to_exist",
    "patient_id_format": "expect_column_values_to_match_regex",
    "amount_range": "expect_column_values_to_be_between"
}
```

## Security & Compliance

### HIPAA Compliance
- **Data Encryption**: At rest and in transit
- **Access Controls**: Role-based access
- **Audit Logging**: Complete audit trail
- **PHI Handling**: De-identification in gold layer

### Data Governance
- **Data Classification**: Sensitive data tagging
- **Retention Policies**: 7-year retention for financial data
- **Data Masking**: Non-production environment masking

## Performance Optimization

### Databricks Cluster Configuration
```yaml
cluster_config:
  node_type: "Standard_DS4_v2"
  driver_node_type: "Standard_DS4_v2"
  num_workers: 4
  auto_scaling: true
  min_workers: 2
  max_workers: 8
```

### Data Partitioning Strategy
```python
# Partition by date for optimal query performance
df.write.partitionBy("year", "month").mode("overwrite").saveAsTable("silver.encounters")
```
