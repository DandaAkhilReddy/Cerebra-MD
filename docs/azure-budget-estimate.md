## Regional Considerations
**Recommended Region**: East US 2
- Lower costs compared to West Europe
- HIPAA compliance available
- High availability zones

## Cost Optimization Strategies

### Immediate Savings (10-15%)
1. **Reserved Instances**: 1-year commitment saves 20-30%
2. **Auto-scaling**: Scale down during off-hours
3. **Storage tiering**: Move old data to cool/archive tiers
4. **Spot instances**: Use for non-critical batch processing

### Long-term Savings (20-25%)
1. **3-year Reserved Instances**: Up to 60% savings
2. **Azure Hybrid Benefit**: If applicable
3. **Databricks committed usage**: Volume discounts
4. **Data archival**: Move to cheaper storage tiers

## Budget Alerts & Governance
- Set budget alerts at 80% and 100% thresholds
- Monthly cost reviews and optimization
- Resource tagging for cost allocation
- Automated shutdown policies for dev/test

## ROI Justification
### Current Manual Process Costs
- **FTE Analysts**: 3 analysts Ã— $80K = $240K annually
- **Time spent on reporting**: 40 hours/week = $50K annually
- **Total Manual Cost**: $290K annually

### Platform Benefits
- **Automation savings**: 80% reduction in manual work = $232K annually
- **Platform cost**: $30K annually
- **Net savings**: $202K annually (675% ROI)

## Implementation Timeline & Costs

### Phase 1: Core Platform (Months 1-2)
- **Setup cost**: $500 (one-time)
- **Monthly cost**: $800-1000
- **Components**: Frontend, Backend, Basic analytics

### Phase 2: Advanced Analytics (Months 3-4)
- **Additional cost**: $400-600/month
- **Components**: Databricks pipelines, ML models

### Phase 3: Full Production (Month 5+)
- **Total monthly cost**: $1,800-2,500
- **Components**: All features, monitoring, backups

## Risk Mitigation
